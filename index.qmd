I've been working at 360info for about a year

We're a research-driven newswire, and we give everything away for free under Creative Commons so that all journalists can benefit from it

Part of my role is creating our visuals. (click)

That means I do everything: coding, design and analysis.

As our team grows, I'm also working with our infrastructure partners and looking for ways to make it easier for reporters and editors to use our charts

## Quick message vs slow, considered message

I've become really interested in the difference between "HERE IS A QUICK MESSAGE" and "Here's a long, considered message to digest slowly..."

## But understanding can change with time and context

::: {.notes}
That said, charts don't _always_ have a fixed amount of view time.

TV broadcast graphics have to work within a fixed view window, but the graphics could be republished online

:::{.notes}

This is obviously a super reductive way to talk about how long we look at chart - there are ways to tackle the long view in certain contexts, like building a graphic up piece by piece, or introducing concepts earlier in a story.

But I think it's helpful to think about short and long views because it helps us figure out how much simplification is necessary.

## Layered complexity: climate stripes

![Climate stripes in their original form](/images/climate-stripes.png)

:::{.notes}
I'm also not suggesting that every graphic should avail itself of hidden meaning if you stare at it long enough.

Some graphics are designed for a specific purpose. The climate stripes are a good example of this:

They tell a really simple message that really only depends on a basic awareness of the idea of climate change

But if you need to talk about _anything_ else, they can be too simple.

:::{.notes}
In fact, the climate stripes website has variations you can download that add
more typical chart elements, like axes, or even turning them into a conventional
barchart.

Even this last chart doesn't explicitly say what the measurement is.

That's particularly interesting because a good chunk of physical climate is the
patterns we see across time and space

That means we have a lot of jargon for talking about spatial and temporal scales

I'm going to retread a bit of what Amanda has talked about this morning looking
at text, because text is a big part of this!

TODO - return to this! Why doesn't it say "annual average temperature"?

## Example

What do we think this graphic is telling us? Yell it out

Okay, this could be literally anything 😅

:::{.notes}
This is... not much better, tbh!

Could be warming, fire risk, 
:::

# [[Temperature]{.hl .hl-red} projections]{style="color: white"} { background="linear-gradient(45deg, #ed213a, #93291e)"}


# [[Rainfall]{.hl .hl-blue} projections]{style="color: white;"} {background="linear-gradient(45deg, #00aadd, #66dd00)"}

::: {.notes}
All of this is fine when we're talking about heat, because the relationship between global warming and extreme heat is really clear.

It would be really hard to find a definition of heatwaves that isn't getting worse in most parts of the world.

Rainfall is another beast:

- rainfall patterns are changing in different ways around different parts of the world;
- changes are very dependent on how you define extreme rainfall;
- climate models less confidence in future rainfall changes than temperature

So future rainfall stories can be challenging to tell quickly.

::: {.notes}
But rainfall stories are important!

Perth—all of SW Aus, in fact—has a rainfall problem.

Specifically a winter rainfall problem.

In the cooler months between April and October, Perth has lost a quarter of its rainfall over the last 120 years.

This is one of the clearest signals on total rainfall in the world

And it's a place where climate models agree we'll see more declines

So how do we tell that story?

## 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Messages {.text-lime-cyan}

::: {.incremental}
* Winter rainfall going down
* Bad for agriculture
* We expect the decline to continue
* Less warming = less decline
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Challenges {.text-lime-cyan}

::: {.incremental}
* This decline is clearly in the **cool season** (esp. winter)
* We have seasonal rainfall projection **figures**, but...
* Only annual **maps** (not seasonal)
