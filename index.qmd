:::{.notes}

This is obviously a super reductive way to talk about how long we look at chart - there are ways to tackle the long view in certain contexts, like building a graphic up piece by piece, or introducing concepts earlier in a story.

But I think it's helpful to think about short and long views because it helps us figure out how much simplification is necessary.

## Layered complexity: climate stripes

![Climate stripes in their original form](/images/climate-stripes.png)

:::{.notes}
I'm also not suggesting that every graphic should avail itself of hidden meaning if you stare at it long enough.

Some graphics are designed for a specific purpose. The climate stripes are a good example of this:

They tell a really simple message that really only depends on a basic awareness of the idea of climate change

But if you need to talk about _anything_ else, they can be too simple.

:::{.notes}
In fact, the climate stripes website has variations you can download that add
more typical chart elements, like axes, or even turning them into a conventional
barchart.

Even this last chart doesn't explicitly say what the measurement is.

That's particularly interesting because a good chunk of physical climate is the
patterns we see across time and space

That means we have a lot of jargon for talking about spatial and temporal scales

I'm going to retread a bit of what Amanda has talked about this morning looking
at text, because text is a big part of this!

TODO - return to this! Why doesn't it say "annual average temperature"?

::: {.notes}
My colleagues in journalism call this different things

The "Hey Martha"

The marmalade drop

The **purpose** is about what you want out of communicating;

The **point** is about finding something that will catch your audience's attention

In newsrooms, editors are trained to make sure this moment hits in the opening paragraph or two

Readers shouldn't be shrugging and saying "so what?"

This is really hard to evaluate when we're talking about our own work!

There is lots of work that is useful and important but that doesn't have an immediate angle.

Sometimes we need to get creative!

Here's an example of a time series from my last job, running during the weather segment in the evening news.

In this case, the graphics team took the graphic we supplied and remade it.

First question: who's our audience? We could just say the public, but let's be more specific and say that it's people watching the evening news.

That tells us a few more things: they don't have much time. About 7 seconds, and
they might be multi-tasking.

Our purpose here was to present evidence of climate change.

But that's not the _point_.

The point is that things are warming up close to home.

::: {.notes}
There're a lot of potential messages in this chart.

But the first things people see emphasise our point.

Everything else is secondary. If we're lucky, astute viewers might understand that the climate varies from year to year, or that we have a long, authoritative record here. 

These graphics were designed to be repeated each month; maybe people will pick these messages up with repeated views.

But the primary message is designed to be understood even if someone reads the headline and misses the chart.

Or if they just see the rising trend line and the orange background but miss everything else.
:::

##  {.text-indigo-pink .center style="text-align:center"}

::: {.notes}
In a broadcast TV graphic, the point is basically the whole thing!

This piece on the right is a longform scrollytelling piece.

You might be tempted to think that you have more time here

But the point is still important! People can and do close out of articles if the message doesn't land

Scrollytelling pieces often build a complex visual up piece-by-piece. That's important to help the reader understand.

But that doesn't mean they start the _story_ with the meaning of chart axes or colours.

The point emotionally invests viewers. Then you can add context to the point and explain the need to go complex.

_Then_ you can build a visual up.

"Climate is what we expect; weather is what we get"

A good chunk of physical climate is the patterns we see across time and the three dimensions of space

That means we have a lot of jargon for talking about spatial and temporal scales

This is a tricky dance: in some cases we can get away with an apparent loss of precision in our words, because of the context.

"Daytime temp" != "Maximum temperature", but audiences have been trained to relate the two. (So long as the difference isn't important to this application!)

The other interesting thing is that people's intuition starts to drift - not just with complexity in the measure, but with the time and especially space scales

When we talk about daily temperature in a city, people link it to their experience

If we talk about a hot day across Australia, that's a little harder to grasp!

Once you get to the point of a country or the globe having a hot or cold year, it starts to be more of an intellectual exercise

:::

## Trickier jargon {.text-red-brown .center style="text-align: center"}

#### eg. extreme rainfall

::: {style="column-count: 2; color: darkred"}
Num. days ‚â• fixed threshold

Num. days ‚â• historical quantile

% total rain falling on those days

Rainiest 3-day stretch

Rainiest 5-day stretch

etc.
:::

::: {.notes}
This trade-off becomes more difficult as our statistics start to become indices.

There are many ways to characterise extreme rainfall:

The difference between these may not be important for your audience - it might be enough to say "there are more wet days" or "we're seeing more extreme rainfall"

But if our conclusion is sensitive to the choice of index, we could have a communication problem

The solution then might not be "use a very long compound noun or an acronym"; it may be "this story is more complex than we thought".

We need to ask ourselves about our purpose and our point again.
